# csharp-tictactoe
A C# game of tictactoe vs AI in 3 difficulties. 

## Pull and compile, the game is ready to run in your console! 

This was one of my first non-curriculum projects during my time at The Software Guild. It is a game of Tic Tac Toe with 3-difficulty AI. 

I never got around to making it two player, but the impossible mode **should** be impossible to beat!
